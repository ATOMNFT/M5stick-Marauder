<b>Want wifi-marauder on that tiny m5stickC plus or m5stickC plus2? Tried to build from source and hitting brick walls? Then this repo is what you're looking for! A simple way to install marauder on these cool tiny devices! 
<br><br>
These versions (v13.10) & (v1.0.0) of marauder for m5stickC plus & m5stickC plus2 contains a few great fixes and v13.10 contains a clean bootscreen (Read more about the fixes below). <br>
